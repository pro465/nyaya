# nyaya
This aims to be a very simple theorem verifier based on [sequent calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus) and [Metamath](https://us.metamath.org/) to educate myself and others about the basics of theorem provers.

Examples are on the examples directory.

For instructions on installation and how to prove your theorems in nyaya, see [tutorial](./tutorial.md).

For the mathematical foundations of nyaya, see [foundations](./foundations.md).
